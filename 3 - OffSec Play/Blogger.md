- Checking further on /fonts directory found blog folder. Looking further into the blog folder it redirects the page into the url http://blogger.pg
- Updated the /etc/hosts file with the entry for the website dns
- Wapplyzer confirmed the CMS as WordPress.
- Using the WPscan we found the 2 user and 2 plugins.
- Tried to brute force the password for the users but it was not successful.
- Found the outdated plugin wpdiscuz 7.0.4 which vulnerable to arbitrary file upload.
- But the exploit was giving error hence tried manually into the comment section of the post.
- I had a php-reverse shell and tried to upload it but was expecting images. So I added the GIf signature GIF89a; and renamed the file php â†’gif. This did not give me a shell :(. I just added the GIF signature and left the file extension to .php.
- Once submitting the comment, I clicked on the shell.php (might be invisible!) and got the reverse shell. #wordpress
